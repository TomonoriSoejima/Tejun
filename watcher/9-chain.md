POST _watcher/watch/mywatch/_execute

The provided code is a set of Elasticsearch commands written in JSON format. Here is a summary of the code:

1. The code begins with PUT commands to create documents in two different indices: "country" and "city". The documents in the "country" index have a "state" field and a "country" field, while the documents in the "city" index have a "state" field and a "city" field.

2. The code then proceeds to define a watcher named "mywatch" using the PUT command. The watcher is triggered at a schedule interval of every 10 minutes.

3. The input section of the watcher is defined as a chain with two inputs. The first input performs a search operation on the "country" index, looking for documents that have a "query_string" match for the term "japan". 

4. The second input performs a search operation on the "city" index, specifically looking for documents that have a "match" query for the "state" field. The value for the "state" field is extracted from the first input's search result using the mustache template "{{ctx.payload.first.hits.hits.1._source.state}}".

5. The condition section is defined with a script. The script source is set to "return true", which means the action will be executed regardless of the condition.

6. The actions section defines a log action, which logs information to the Elasticsearch log. The log text is defined using a mustache template, printing the value of the "state" field for each document in the first input's search result and the value of the "city" field for each document in the second input's search result.

7. Finally, the watcher is executed using the POST command to trigger the execution of the defined watcher named "mywatch".
